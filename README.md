# pcb-projects

I started pursuing PCB design Feb 2026. My main project is my Senior Design, which is a pool sensor that detects when someone falls in a pool and notifies the user. The PCB I'm designing for this project will be a bridge between the sensor and a Raspberry Pi. 

I'm using Altium Designer at the moment. I'd like to learn KiCAD in the future.

I use a Botfactory SV2 (provided by Auburn) to print the boards.
